## 1.	Course Rationale & Goal: 

**Rationale/Background:** *Deep learning*, a class of machine learning methods inspired by information processing in the human brain, have revolutionized the way we build machines, automate processes, analyze data, and just problem-solve in a fast-increasing host of domains. These transformational changes have disrupted whole industries, and are expected to impact wide sectors of society. Scholarship in the field has been growing very rapidly, with significant funding provided for both basic research and applications. 


**Goal:** This is a graduate-level, research-focused course aimed at briding the gab between basic deep learning knowledge and novel and bleeding-edge deep learning research. The course will emphasize deep learning methods developed over the past 2-3 years, with more attention allocated to the last year of scholarship in the field. Areas of application will be geared toward student interests, with likely areas being:

* Neural Machine Translation

* Neural Cross-Lingual Natural Language Understanding

* Language and Visual Inteligence

* Deep Learning for Brain Signal

* Bayesian Deep Learning


**Potential audiences for this course are:**

* Students with a deep learning background from any field. This includes people who have taken LING530F (Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing) and those who have taken a graduate-level ML course and are already familiar with deep learning methods. (This course will not cover deep learning basics)


## 2.	Course Objectives: 
Upon completion of this course students will be able to:

* *identify* a sub-area of deep learning research and write a high-quality research paper for a top venue.



## 3.	Course Topics:

TBA (But see above)


## 4.	Prerequisites:  

* Knwoledge of basic deep learning methods (as demonstrated by course work or at least one publication)
 
## 5.	Format of the course: 
•	This course will operate in a seminar fashion where students and the instructor meet twice a week to read novel literature. Each student is required to present at least twice thorough-out the semester. There will also be student-led engineering sessions (1 or 2, but likely more based on interest).

## 6. Course syllabus:

**Required books:**

* Goodfellow, I., Bengio, Y., Courville, A., & Bengio, Y. (2016). Deep learning (Vol. 1). Cambridge: MIT press. Available at: [[link](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)]. 

* Several research papers will be added.


**Other recommended books:**

* TBA

## 10. Course Policies

**Attendance:** The UBC calendar states: “Regular attendance is expected of students in all their classes (including lectures, laboratories, tutorials, seminars, etc.). Students who neglect their academic work and assignments may be excluded from the final examinations. Students who are unavoidably absent because of illness or disability should report to their instructors on return to classes.”

**Evaluation:** All assignments will be marked using the evaluative criteria given in this syllabus.

**Access & Diversity:** Access & Diversity works with the University to create an inclusive living and learning environment in which all students can thrive. The University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the [Access and Diversity unit](https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/access-diversity). You must register with the Disability Resource Centre to be granted special accommodations for any on-going conditions. 
**Religious Accommodation:** The University accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance, submitting assignments, or completing scheduled tests and examinations. Please let your instructor know in advance, preferably in the first week of class, if you will require any accommodation on these grounds. Students who plan to be absent for varsity athletics, family obligations, or other similar commitments, cannot assume they will be accommodated, and should discuss their commitments with the instructor before the course drop date. [UBC policy on Religious Holidays](http://www.universitycounsel.ubc.ca/policies/policy65.pdf).

## Academic Integrity
**Plagiarism**
Plagiarism is the most serious academic offence that a student can commit. Regardless of whether or not it was committed intentionally, plagiarism has serious academic consequences and can result in expulsion from the university. Plagiarism involves the improper use of somebody else's words or ideas in one's work. 

It is your responsibility to make sure you fully understand what plagiarism is. Many students who think they understand plagiarism do in fact commit what UBC calls "reckless plagiarism." Below is an excerpt on reckless plagiarism from UBC Faculty of Arts' leaflet, [Plagiarism Avoided: Taking Responsibility for Your Work](http://www.arts.ubc.ca/arts-students/plagiarism-avoided.html).

"The bulk of plagiarism falls into this category. Reckless plagiarism is often the result of careless research, poor time management, and a lack of confidence in your own ability to think critically. Examples of reckless plagiarism include:

* Taking phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or statistical findings from a variety of sources and piecing them together into an essay (piecemeal plagiarism);
* Taking the words of another author and failing to note clearly that they are not your own. In other words, you have not put a direct quotation within quotation marks;
* Using statistical findings without acknowledging your source;
* Taking another author's idea, without your own critical analysis, and failing to acknowledge that this idea is not yours;
* Paraphrasing (i.e. rewording or rearranging words so that your work resembles, but does not copy, the original) without acknowledging your source;
* Using footnotes or material quoted in other sources as if they were the results of your own research; and
* Submitting a piece of work with inaccurate text references, sloppy footnotes, or incomplete source (bibliographic) information."

Bear in mind that this is only one example of the different forms of plagiarism. Before preparing for their written assignments, students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with the following source on plagiarism: the [Academic Integrity Resource Centre](http://help.library.ubc.ca/researching/academic-integrity).

If after reading these materials you still are unsure about how to properly use sources in your work, please ask me for clarification. Students are held responsible for knowing and following all University regulations regarding academic dishonesty. If a student does not know how to properly cite a source or what constitutes proper use of a source it is the student's personal responsibility to obtain the needed information and to apply it within University guidelines and policies. If evidence of academic dishonesty is found in a course assignment, previously submitted work in this course may be reviewed for possible academic dishonesty and grades modified as appropriate. UBC policy requires that all suspected cases of academic dishonesty must be forwarded to the Dean for possible action.
